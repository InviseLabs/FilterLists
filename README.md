# FilterLists
Curated and custom modified adblock filterlists by Invise Labs, created for several unique purposes, such as anti-coinmining. These lists are often curated and merged from other lists to create the best experience possible. piHole, AdGuard, and other adblockers have performance issues when importing too many lists. We are aiming to create merged lists for specific categories. 

### BlockCoin.txt: Blocks Coin Mining
I find many sites perform coin mining in JS, in which it is crafted to use only 5 to 20% CPU, so that the mining opation is not given away. We have found no real way to detect these occurrences from happening, thus we propose that coin mining is blocked by default in the future. Machine owners wishing ot ultiize such capabilties can explicitly disbale the blocking or allow that local IP.

BlockCoin.txt is merged from the following lists:
